# MERN Stack Authentication Project - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of our MERN stack authentication project. This project is designed to provide user authentication features using the MERN stack. It includes a React.js frontend that communicates with a Node.js and Express.js backend, which is connected to a MongoDB database. This README will help you get started with the project.

## Project Overview

This project serves as the frontend part of a full-stack web application that allows users to register, login, and access protected resources. Here's a high-level overview of the technologies used:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Axios for API communication, React Router for routing, and Redux for state management.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication.
- **Styling:** You can use your preferred CSS framework or tools for styling, such as Bootstrap, Material-UI, or plain CSS.

  - `components/`: React components.
  - `redux/`: Redux store setup and actions.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helper files.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
- `public/`: Static assets, including the HTML file.

## Configuration

Before running the project, make sure to configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the following variables:

```

REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Replace `http://your-backend-api-url` with the URL of your backend API and `your-secret-key` with a secure JWT secret key.
